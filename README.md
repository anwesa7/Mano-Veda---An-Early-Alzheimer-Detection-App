## 🧠*Mano Veda - An Early Detection App*🧠 ##


🚩 **Problem Statement**

Alzheimer’s disease often goes undetected until its later stages, especially in regions where neurological screening is scarce and specialist access is limited.
Early cognitive decline signs — such as subtle memory loss, speech pattern changes, or problem-solving difficulties — can be overlooked due to lack of awareness, cultural stigma, and limited screening tools.
There is a pressing need for an accessible, engaging, and non-invasive early detection system that can reach diverse populations, including those outside major healthcare hubs.

🎯 **Solution – Manoveda**

Manoveda is an AI-powered health-tech application that detects early signs of Alzheimer’s using a combination of cognitive games and voice analysis.
The app makes early detection simple, engaging, and privacy-focused, enabling timely medical intervention and improved quality of life.

✨ **Features Designed for Impact**

🧩 Cognitive Game Assessments – Scientifically designed puzzles and memory challenges to assess attention, recall, and problem-solving ability.

🎤 AI-Powered Voice Analysis – Detects subtle changes in tone, speech fluency, and linguistic complexity that may indicate cognitive decline.

📊 Cognitive Health Tracking – Generates progress reports over time to monitor changes and detect early warning patterns.

🔒 Privacy-First Design – All data is encrypted and processed with full user consent.

🧠 Science-Backed Algorithms – Integrates cognitive neuroscience principles with machine learning for accurate screening.

📱 Cross-Platform Accessibility – Built for mobile devices to ensure maximum reach across geographies.

🛠 **Technologies Used**

AI Frameworks:
>> TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning models

OpenAI Whisper for speech processing:
>> Advanced neural networks for pattern recognition

Web Technologies:
>> React.js, Type Script and Next.js for frontend

>> Node.js for backend development

>> JavaScript and Python programming

Infrastructure:
>> Google Cloud for scalable deployment

>> MongoDB for data storage

>> Secure cloud-based architecture

🌟 **Future Roadmap:**

*"Imagine if just a voice could help someone’s grandfather remember their grandchild’s name again — or help a mother recognize the early signs of a disease that often goes unnoticed until it’s too late."
 With Manoveda, we are working toward a future where early Alzheimer’s detection is as simple, gentle, and accessible as speaking*

**Planned Enhancements:**

📈 Advanced Predictive Analytics – AI models trained on larger datasets for improved accuracy.

🌐 Regional Language Support – Voice and game interfaces in major Indian languages.

🏥 Healthcare Integration – Direct referrals to neurologists and cognitive specialists.

💬 Family & Caregiver Dashboards – Shared reports for collaborative care planning.

🎮 Adaptive Game Difficulty – Cognitive games that adjust based on user performance.

🛡 On-Device Processing – Ensuring sensitive voice and game data never leaves the user’s device.
